This is a temporary package containing icons that will be released in Octicons v10.0.0. If you want to use the latest stable release of Octicons, go <Link href="https://primer.style/octicons/packages/rails">here</Link>.

This rails helper lets you easily include svg octicons in your rails apps.

## Install

1. Add this to your `Gemfile`

    ```rb
    gem 'octicons_v2_helper'
    ```

3. Use this tag in your erbs

    ```rb
    <%= octicon_v2 "alert", :height => 32,  :class => "right left", :"aria-label" => "hi" %>
    ```

We recommend including the CSS in the [`@primer/octicons-v2`](/packages/javascript) npm module. You can also npm install that package and include `build/build.css` in your styles.
